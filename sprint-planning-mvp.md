# üöÄ Guarde.me MVP - Sprint Planning & Progress

## üìã Project Overview

**Guarde.me** is a Portuguese voice-first Android app for capturing memories and scheduling intelligent delivery. Users say "Guarde me" + their memory, and the system uses AI to understand when and how to deliver it back to them.

### üéØ MVP Goals
- Voice-first memory capture with wake word "Guarde me"
- Natural language processing for scheduling (Gemini AI)
- Multi-channel delivery (FCM push, email with .ics)
- RRULE-based recurring schedules
- Privacy-focused architecture with on-device processing
